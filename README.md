# Interactive MATLAB Synthesizer

Built using MATLAB, it displays a GUI to the user and allows them to play digitally synthesized notes on a keyboard along with carrying out a selection of programmed functions and sound effects.
This project was built for my Final Year Project in University of Galway.

The video below is a demo of the synthesizer.
